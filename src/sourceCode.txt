Warning : If your C code contains syntax error, 
the slicing will result in errors or inaccuracies.




In this version, you are invited to use 
variable definitions, comments, strings, variables declarations, 
increment and decrement operators, while loops, do-while loops, 
for loops, affectation operator and escaped newlines.

However, pleace notice that IF/ELSE statements 
and Defines / Macros are not implemented yet.


I still do believe that this demo version offers 
a satisfaying demonstration of the solution and its capabilities.
