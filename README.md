# SliCer
A semantic-based amorphous backward C slicer project

Give a piece of code in C,

Choose your variable,

Indicate a line,

Slice.


Or at least that's the idea... For the moment this project is only a demo version.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run this program on your personal computer:

- Windows would be desirable, since I cannot guarantee the proper functioning of the programs under another operating system.
- A recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required (version 3.5 or higher is recommended). 



### Installing

Getting the files

```
Download a clone of the project to your computer.
Lauch the executable.
Do not move or remove anyfile from the original folder.
```

## Running the tests

This is how to run the automated tests for this system: 

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
